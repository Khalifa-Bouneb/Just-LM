# Just-LM: Language Modeling from Scratch 🧠🚀

## 📋 Introduction

Welcome to **Just-LM**, a personal deep dive into **Language Modeling (LM)**.
This repository documents my journey through **Stanford CS336: Language Modeling**, focusing on building models and ideas **from scratch** using **PyTorch**.

The goal is to reproduce key techniques from influential papers and lectures, gaining both **theoretical understanding** and **hands-on experience** with large language models — from simple RNNs to modern Transformers.

## 🚀 Beyond CS336: Advanced Language Modeling

Once the course foundation is solid, the plan is to go **beyond the curriculum**, including:

* Implementing Transformer variants (GPT, BERT, RoPE, etc.)
* Exploring efficient training (FlashAttention, LoRA, Quantization)
* Training a small GPT-style model from scratch
* Experimenting with dataset curation, evaluation, and alignment

## 🧠 Technologies

* **Framework:** PyTorch
* **Environment:** Python 3.10+ / Jupyter Notebooks
* **Tools:** NumPy, Matplotlib, tqdm, tokenizers
